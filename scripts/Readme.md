# [Pre-processing] Generate Color Map File
- This is one of the offline pre-processings for extracting `color` information in each image
- This script will generate a mapping file `map.json`
- This is written in `Javascript` with `Node.js` (Prerequisition)
- The generated mapping file has already been included in the project. Generally, there's `no` need to rerun this script unless the subsampling parameters were changed.

# Run
```sh
npm install
node main.js
```
